It's my 40th birthday tomorrow, and I'm starting a blog. I seem, finally, to have some things to say: thoughts on software engineering, programming, computing history ... all sorts.

I had a very nice thing happen to me today, which somewhat validates the beginning of my fifth Earthian decade: the maintainer of a library I use got excited about an idea I contributed (the idea was backed up by some working code, but it wasn't, like, a pull request or anything). This kind of engagement gives me real hope for my future, and my son's; I mean, all I ever had was Lego :).

OK. Let's go. Watch these spaces.
