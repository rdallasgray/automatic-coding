Been a while. Here's a short one on some of the stuff I listen to when
I have the time. It's intended primarily to solicit responses of the
'You like that? Then you'll like this!' variety -- I need more
material.

So, top five.

##Ruby Rogues
[link](http://rubyrogues.com)

An indisputable number one. Doesn't matter whether you're a Rubyist --
you'll get something from this. It's very well produced, the regulars
are well-practised, and the guests are frequently stellar (Kent Beck,
e.g.). Despite (or perhaps because of) the Ruby focus, the topics tend
to be relevant to software engineering in general, especially the reading list
episodes: Patterns of Application Architecture, Smalltalk Best
Practice Patterns, Growing Object Oriented Software ... it's the
canon, not just the Ruby stuff. Highly recommended.

##The Changelog

An overview of what's happening in open source. Very on the
pulse. Great guests, good production values and educated hosts
(although, in the nicest possible way, Adam Stacoviak would benefit
the show by doing more listening and less talking).

##Javascript Jabber

I'm paying less attention to Javascript these days, but I still
subscribe to and enjoy this podcast. Same stable as Ruby Rogues, and
same presenter (the very personable Charles Max Wood); similarly high
production values, too. Good guests and high-level chat.

##Mostly Erlang
[link](http://mostlyerlang.com)

It's interesting to get a bit out of your comfort zone. Erlang people
talk about different stuff. The show is patterned after the Ruby
Rogues/Javascript Jabber format, but the nature of the community is so
different that it's not really comparable; production values are
lower, but the guests, and the general tone, are much more oriented
toward serious systems engineering, which makes a refreshing listen,
for me.

##Pragmatic Podcasts
[link](http://pragprog.com/podcasts)

Somewhat few and far between (it's hard to tell if they're even still
going), these are what you'd expect from the PragProg stable: serious,
somewhat conservative, but very valuable. At their best they afford a
very high-level view of the practice of software development.

Honourable mentions: [NodeUp](http://nodeup.com), [Git Minutes](http://episodes.gitminutes.com), [Food Fight](http://foodfightshow.org).

Don't even talk to me about the Dev Show.
